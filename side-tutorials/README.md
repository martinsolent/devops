# Side Tutorials

We will set up a DevOps process supporting a JavaScript application. Specifically, we will use React, MongoDB, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. I should, however, make clear, this course is not about learning these technologies; rather, it is about putting in place sound DevOps practices around the technology. With that being said, you will need to understand how to use these technologies to make a web application. As such, I intend to release several on-demand tutorial videos that will bring you up-to-speed with these technologies.
